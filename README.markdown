AUI Enhancements
================

This Speakeasy extension provides some simple enhancement to the AUI JS library bundled in Atlassian products.
It will allow any AUI Dialog to be moved by clicking and dragging in its title bar, and you can also scale the
dialog by spinning your mouse wheel (only in newer webkit based browsers, eg. Chrome).

You can also remove the grey blanket by double clicking on it, giving you access to the underlying page.

I'm entering this into the Atlassian [Codegeist](http://codegeist.atlassian.com/entry/168778) 2011 competition to
complement my other entry "Stylicious", by making its dialog less obtrusive and allowing you to also style AUI dialogs.

Product Support
---------------

It's been tested only in Confluence, but it should work in any product that uses AUI, such as JIRA.
